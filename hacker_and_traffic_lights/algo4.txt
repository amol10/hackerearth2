sol4 optimization approach.

q: is the list of all signals
cq: is the queue of the changes needed, one entry for each signal

initially, cq = []

1. start
2. go to the first signal in q
3. make changes to make it G
4. push change count to cq
5. go to next signal
6. apply changes to it if it is in the 'x' window
7. go to 3

applying changes:

1. index in q: i
2. add up the changes for indices i-x to i-1 (x or x-1?) : ach
3. apply ach%3 to q[i]

total changes will be the total of all the entries in cq

tch (total changes)
wch (total window changes)

maintain a wch var, as you push into cq, add to it
as you pop from cq, subtract from it

var tch, as you pop from cq, add to it
in the end, add wch to it and print it
